# WebCrawler_for_108Star_in_Yilan

Hello,

I started this web cwawl project because a classmates of mine once expressed his willing to know who else in Yilan is also accepted by the same program/school as he is.
Due to the privacy concerns, some schools don't put their admission results online. So it makes getting the data we need a little bit harder.
So I decided to collect the data by crawling all the admission results in Yilan from "交叉查榜", which is a webiste that collects admission data.
However, this website splits their data into multiple pages. For instance, Yilan's data is splitted into about 60 pages.
So instead of opening each of them, I write a program to do it for me.
